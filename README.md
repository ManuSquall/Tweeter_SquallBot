# Tweeter SquallBot

This is Python bot script which connect to  twitter API with [Tweepy library](https://www.tweepy.org/) to perfom some actions. Actually it notify me by direct message about a list of account who unfollow me since the last check. I hosted on Azure like a webjob and define a CRON expression to schedule it.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install:

```
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) (i used 3.8.5 version)
- [Tweepy library](https://www.tweepy.org/) (a module to install with pip)
```

## Getting Started

First make sure you have a twitter account and a twitter dev account for tokens things to access the API, [click for a good article about it ðŸ™‚](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/accessing-the-twitter-api-with-tweepy-8421329afc5c).

After just download the repo. To make it work actually you will have to replace all string occurences of "manusquall" by your twitter name (this one with "@"). It's different from your screen name and is unique.

A "python .\squallbot.py" command should finally run it (in PowerShell if you are on windows) in the project directory.
